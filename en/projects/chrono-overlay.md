# Chrono Overlay

## Description

Ever wanted to check how long are you playing that Dungeon or how long are you creating that hard Spreadsheet?

This application create an easy Overlay Chronometer, from now on called Chrono Overlay. It'll live above all your Desktop Applications. By design we have a sleek design, so it'll stay on top but without getting into the way, having it's main icon on the Windows Systray (besides the clock). You can resize and recolor it by interacting with the clickable smart menu.

The following itens are on the smart menu:

- Start/Stop
- Set Shortcut!
- Reset
- Name it!
- Show/Hide Name
- Transparent
- Font
- Save
- Load

They are very intuitive and self explanatory, but for starters, set a name (optional) to the Chrono Overlay, set a Shortcut and start playing/working on something.

Example 1 - Dungeon time to kill the boss (F6)
Example 2 - Completing the tax calculations (F5)

Than you just have to press the function key to START and STOP the Chrono. Very usefull in a gaming scenario!!!

You can only set one Chrono Overlay at this point, but we will update it later with multiple Chrono Overlays.
